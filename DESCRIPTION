Description: This package is designed for time series data. Fits Vector
    Autoregressive models and Vector Autoregressive models with Exogenous
    Inputs.  For speedup, fastVAR can use multiple cpu cores to calculate the
    estimates.  For very large systems, fastVAR uses Lasso penalty to return
    very sparse coefficient matrices. Regression diagnostics can be used to
    compare models, and prediction functions can be used to calculate the
    n-step ahead prediction.
