Description: This package is designed for time series data.
  Fits Vector Autoregressive models and Vector Autoregressive models
  with Exogenous Inputs.  For speedup, fastVAR can use multiple cpu cores 
  to calculate the estimates.  For very large systems,
  fastVAR uses Lasso penalty to return very sparse coefficient matrices. 
  Regression diagnostics can be used to compare models, and prediction functions 
  can be used to calculate the n-step ahead prediction.  Faster implementations
  in C coming soon.
